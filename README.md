JHU Data Science : Getting and Cleaning Data: project

This script reads in files from the Galaxy S2 movement data set in the current
directory, extracts on the columns with mean / Mean / std (standard deviation
in the column names, prepends the subject and activity columns, and then
subsets the data frame to give the mean of each of the phone movement
data column for each activity of each subject. 

Please see the code itself (run_analysis.R) for full commentary describing
 each part of the R script.
